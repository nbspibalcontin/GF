            <p>I just want to tell you something that’s been on my heart. I love you, and I’ve loved you every day. You mean so much to me, and I want to be the best version of myself for you.

                I promise to always do my best to understand you, be there for you when you need me, and listen to you no matter what.
                
                You’re so special to me, and I hope I can be more than a friend—I want to be someone who loves and supports you every day.</p>
